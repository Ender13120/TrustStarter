## TrustStarter: A Decentralized Fundraising Platform with Milestone-based Accountability

### TrustStarter Abstract:
This decentralized application (DApp) offers a more accountable and transparent variation of the traditional Kickstarter platform. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, the system empowers backers with voting rights, ensuring projects are held accountable for their milestones before funds are disbursed.

### Key Features:
1. **Milestone-Based Payouts:**
   - Project creators define various milestones with corresponding descriptions and percentage allocations from the total campaign goal.
   - Funds are disbursed to the campaign owner only when a milestone is achieved and approved by the backers.
   
2. **Backer Voting System:**
   - Backers have the right to vote on the completion of each milestone.
   - If a milestone vote fails three times consecutively, the campaign is deemed inactive.

3. **Dissolution Voting:**
   - The campaign owner can initiate a dissolution vote.
   - A successful dissolution vote ends the campaign prematurely.

4. **Refund Mechanism:**
   - In cases of campaign failure, investors can withdraw refunds proportional to their investment.

5. **Open Comments:**
   - Campaign owners can add comments to their campaigns, providing regular updates or necessary clarifications to backers.

6. **Transparent Access:**
   - All campaign details, milestones, votes, and comments are publicly accessible.
   - Investors can track campaigns they've backed, ensuring transparency.

### Benefits:
- **Enhanced Accountability:** The milestone-based structure ensures projects are making promised progress before funds are released.
- **Backer Empowerment:** By giving backers a voice through the voting mechanism, they can ensure their funds are used appropriately.
- **Transparency:** Every transaction and decision is recorded on the blockchain, providing unparalleled transparency to all participants.
- **Security:** Leveraging Ethereum's smart contract capability ensures that the rules of the platform are executed as written, minimizing trust-based risks.

### Why do we need Web3 in the current Space?
While Kickstarter and Indiegogo et al have revolutionized crowdfunding, enabling countless innovations to come to life, they have not been without their challenges. 

One significant issue that has plagued these platforms is the emergence of fraudulent projects or creators who fail to deliver on their promises, leaving backers without their expected rewards or any form of recompense. 

This problem stems from the inherent **trust-based** model where funds are disbursed upfront **without any accountability measures**. 

Unlike TrustStarter, once a project on Kickstarter or Indiegogo meets its funding goal, the creator receives the funds almost immediately, **regardless of whether they fulfill their project commitments**. 

In contrast, TrustStarter's **milestone-based disbursement system**, combined with the backer voting mechanism, directly addresses this vulnerability. By **holding project creators accountable** for each stage of their development and only releasing funds upon achieving and validating milestones, TrustStarter offers a more robust, transparent, and reliable platform. 

This approach drastically reduces the potential for scams and failed projects, offering backers greater confidence and security in their investments.

### Summary:
TrustStarter aims to revitalize the crowdfunding model by providing a **transparent**, **accountable**, and **decentralized Community** Fundraising alternative. By prioritizing **backer rights** and project accountability through blockchain technology, it fosters trust, ensures progress, and sets a new standard for crowdfunding platforms in the future.
